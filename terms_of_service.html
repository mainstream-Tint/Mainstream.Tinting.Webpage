                <li>
                    <strong>B. Price Adjustment for Inaccurate Information:</strong> Any quote provided by Mainstream Tinting based on client-submitted measurements, photos, or descriptions is provisional.

                The client agrees to maintain a safe and non-hostile environment for Mainstream Tinting personnel while on their property.
